Therefore, the efficient transformation of urban energy systems is becoming a crucial step towards carbon neutrality and more effective climate protection. The Positive Energy District (PED) concept has been pointed out as one of the key principles of this path. The Positive Energy District concept leads towards an integrated and sustainable urban development with an emphasis on the use of renewable energy sources and attention shifting from energy performance at the level of individual buildings to the level of the entire district. However, PEDs represent a relatively new and still not sufficiently explored area in the field of sustainable development. The aim of this paper is to describe the technical part of the new holistic assessment and innovative process of stakeholder engagement to identify Positive Energy Districts in the early development phase that arises within the PED-ID project. The early development phase is crucial since the structure of the urban area is being decided along with its sustainability and climate protection levels. The assessment methodology is based on the creation and optimization of energy balance scenarios. Case studies of existing urban areas have been developed in order to verify the methodology. It is concluded that this innovative methodology devised for PED evaluation, together with strengthening of knowledge-based and decision-making framework, will help to accelerate the process of transforming the current urban energy systems into more efficient and renewable systems. © 2022 The Author(s).",assessment methods; Positive energy districts; sustainable urban development,,Conference paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85159934307,251,1674,The aim of the PED-ID project is to accelerate the process of transforming the current urban energy systems into more efficient and renewable systems.

One cannot talk about durable development without taking into account the sustainability criterion which is essential in all areas of activity. Traditional constructions made of masonry elements from unburned clay or other vernacular materials, using sheep wool mattresses for thermal insulation, successfully meet the conditions imposed by this criterion. Constructions made of natural materials, ensure the responsible use of non-renewable natural resources, the possibility of reuse and recycling of materials, contribute to environmental protection and pollution reduction, are energy saving and provide an hygienic, pleasant and healthy living climate. The aim of this paper is to present the experimental results obtained regarding the mechanical properties of the elements of unburned clay masonry with the addition of vegetable fibers from waste and of bio-eco-innovative wool mattresses, of different thicknesses. Following the results obtained on the 2 types of construction materials, based on clay with the addition of vegetable fibers, and sheep wool mattresses as thermal insulation material, it can be stated that they can be used successfully in construction. © 2022 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

One of the efforts made to promote sustainable construction is the use of Geopolymer concrete. It emits less greenhouse gas than conventional concrete. Additionally investigated and the outcomes with control concrete were the impact of accelerated corrosion on Geopolymer concrete. Through the investigation, it was discovered that geopolymer concrete is less porous and has a smaller linear curve than control concrete. Since concrete has been used for construction, it has been exposed to the effects of acidic environments. Therefore, when concrete is used in an environment where it will be exposed to the effects of acids, it is exposed to these effects for the duration of its usage. Now, the use of acids which used for checking the durability characteristics of Geo-polymer concrete to conduct the test with 5% H2SO4 solution and 5% H2CO3 solution to the concrete specimens to find out the acid attack test and carbonation test.

Further enhancement of the UAS sector has brought forward tangible applications that illustrate how this technology can assist in improving community health, collective education and stimulate economic growth. There are numerous practical examples of how UAS contribute to the SDG’s of climatologists today. Outlined in this paper are some of the most prominent UAS applications and their resulting benefits to society. The development and global roll out of the UAS has created significant opportunity for climate scientists studying toxic gas emissions and the chemistry of Earth’s atmosphere. UAS make emission monitoring more accurate, contribute to gas leak detection at industrial facilities and greatly assist plant efficiency and optimization. UAS help simplify the data collection process by allowing remote pilots to quickly survey industrial plants and allow them to carry payloads of scientific equipment such as spectrometers which can be used for Differential Optical Absorbance Spectroscopy (DOAS) or thermal cameras designed to detect thermal anomalies.

Soil is a primary component for plant production, although it is often considered only as a physical support for plant growth. However, the concerns of mankind over the sustainability of agriculture have made it possible to consider that soil is a living, high-quality system and should, therefore, be preserved. This is the result of several interactions between biological components, including microbial communities, essential for physical-chemical operation. Agricultural crops are threatened by diseases transmitted through the soil, making them difficult to control because of the “hidden” character of pathogens and low efficiency of conventional treatments. These practices greatly affect the quality of the soil, which, in turn, affects the state of crop quality. One of the goals of this paper is to show that, despite the age of the concept of soil quality and the existence of numerous studies, the application of soil quality recommendations would play an important role in crops. However, there is a certain methodology for obtaining soil quality indices that could be suggested in this paper, a methodology based and developed on the basis of previously conducted research in the field. Under current conditions, highlighted by an intensification of globalization processes, sustainable development brings together the main economic and social factors to meet the present needs of mankind without compromising those of future generations. © 2022 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

Environmental problems are intertwined with socioeconomic problems, especially in poor developing countries. In addition, environmental management faces a number of challenges in the modern world. Increasingly, countries will face a number of challenges, which will be a major threat to developing countries, as they do not have sufficient financial and material resources and, on the other hand, have similar socio-economic and physical problems. This article will attempt to outline the socio-economic problems resulting from rising average temperatures, which will outline the challenges facing institutions responsible for environmental management processes. Attention will be paid to the emergence of unstable and sometimes extreme weather conditions, including the increase in the intensity of solar radiation, the increase in water supply problems. In addition, the challenges of environmental management and environmental assessment of soils are linked to the ever-increasing share of contaminated and nutrient-poor soils for plants. Also noteworthy is the implementation of reduced control by the responsible institutions for vectors of diseases on flora and fauna. The lack of regular funding to monitor indicators to assess progress and success in developing and solving environmental and social problems should not be overlooked. Through the use and conduct of comprehensive statistical analysis, descriptive analysis, diagnostic and forecasting analysis, an attempt will be made to identify the main problems facing the economy and environmental management, as well as to outline the challenges facing developing countries in the 21st century. © 2022 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

The global COVID-19 pandemic spread in late 2019 and turned into one of the biggest challenges facing all industries including the oil and gas industry- in decades. The most challenging aspect of COVID-19 is its contagion rate, and its ability to spread from both non-symptomatic and symptomatic people to others who are in close contact through respiratory droplets, by direct contact with infected persons, or by contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. Today, we must consider this new reality into business continuity planning and take all necessary precautions to mitigate its spread within the organization. As the health and safety of the employees and contractors is paramount to the Company and based on the Company commitment to provide better service quality to its clients, a thorough emergency response system that includes precaution measures to help fighting against COVID-19 and its potential to negatively impact the business was created. Furthermore, The Company COVID-19 Management Standard set the minimum requirements, to manage the risks associate to the COVID-19. A Crisis Management Team was formed to oversee the implementation of COVID-19 decisions and raise awareness within the Company. All field personnel were required to comply to COVID-19 precautions during operations. With the implementation of new procedures, we were able to maintain the lowest confirmed case numbers among all the companies in our operational sector. Though it was challenging at the beginning for employees to comply, the new requirements have become the normal standard today. These new measures focus on the importance of employee health and safety when working through COVID-19 pandemic and has helped to educate people on the importance of following health and safety procedures as way of life for everyone while maintaining the Company Operational Sustainability.
