Day 1: 2024-06-14 (Friday)
+ Looked for the 17 SDGs and recorded their definitions.
+ Task 2: Done

+ Wrote search script in Python to find documents from Scopus.

+ Successfully recorded 5000 results for the corpus construct

- 5000 results only
- Hit with limit on number of results that can be retrieved over a single query in Scopus API.

+ Modified the script to execute multiple queries over period of time.
+ Modified the script to avoid rate limiting by Scopus API.
-> Script under execution (Results from 2001 onwards are being recorded)
- Colab disconnected due to time limit errors
+ Started running the script again on reduced results from 2010 onwards to avoid run time limits on Colab.

- Dateformat of the queries didn't match the Scopus API requirements.
+ Modified the script to use `pubyear` instead of `date`.

+ Wrote short script for cleaning the results (seems redundant now)

+ Wrote another script to extract abstracts from the results.
-> Script under execution (Results from the reduced set of 5000 results are being recorded)
- The script finished but there was a change in API
+ Modified the script with a newly added function to get the correct abstracts using DOI of texts.
+ Verified the stability of script by running it on a small set of results.

+ Obtained ~3500 abstracts from the Scopus API.
- 1500 abstracts could not be extracted.
+ Finished building a small dataset of abstracts for the corpus and testing.



Day 2: 2024-06-15 (Saturday)
+ Obtained 70,000 result records from Scopus API (2024-2025).
+ Started executing the script to extract abstracts for each record from the Scopus API for the complete corpus.



Day 3: 2024-06-16 (Sunday)
+ Obtained 118,779 records from Scopus API (2000-2025).



Day 4: 2024-06-17 (Monday)
+ Filtered 55,062 records with abstracts from the corpus of 120,248 records.
+ Task 4: Done

- Data size problems

++ Adding Conference papers manually
+ scopus_0: 2010-2012 19k
+ scopus_1: 2013-2015 19k
+ scopus_2: 2016-2017 15k
+ scopus_3: 2018-2019 19k
+ scopus_4: 2020-2020 11k
+ scopus_5: 2021-2021 12k
+ scopus_6: 2022-2023 18k
+ scopus_7: 2024-2025 3k

+ Combined all the data into a single file.
+ Checked for missing abstracts using a script.



Day 5: 2024-06-18 (Tuesday)
+ Packed data and notebook in folder
+ Compiled a list of embedding techniques with notes


Day 6: 2024-06-19 (Wednesday)
+ Implemented Universal Sentence Encoder
+ Implemented FastText
+ Implemented GloVe
+ Implemented ELMo
+ Implemented Sentence Transformers

Day 7: 2024-06-20 (Thursday)
+ Connected appropriate FastText model through Drive
+ Looked through semantic similarity measures
+ Implemented Cosine Similarity
+ Ran test experiments on four techniques for demonstration
+ Cleaned up notebook
+ Did some knowledge gathering on the topic


Week 2:
    + Extensively optimized hyperparameters for Pegasus and BART
    + Compared the performance of Pegasus and BART
    Implemented BART for preliminary analysis

    + Generated SDG summaries using GPT-4o
    + Generated SDG summaries using Sonnet-3.5
    + Generated Abstract summaries using BART
    - Colab failed to generate summaries
    + Generated summaries using Eniac
    
    + Generated Similarity scores using use
    + Generated Similarity scores using sentence transformers
    + Generated Similarity scores using fasttext
    + Generated Similarity scores using glove
    + Generated Similarity scores using elmo

    + Implemented some code to find top 3 matching SDGs
